## Context:
<!-- wins, challenges, about 20 hours spent, goals, approaches etc -->
This project was completed over 2 one-week sprints (*about 35 hours*). The team comprised 2 frontend developers and 3 backend developers as a Capstone Project for the final inning of Turing School of Software and Design bootcamp. [Part 1](https://github.com/Brain-Defrost/Brain-Defrost_FE/blob/main/.github/Brain%20Defrost%20Demo.gif) of the project was planning and completing our app's minimum viable product (MVP). Part 2 focused on refinement and adding additional features like
- Full connection to BE
- Background job for stats emails
- Enhanced UI with elements like modals, responsive design, and loading displays
- Multiplayer capability


### Goals

<details close>
  
  ```
  - Use scrum methodology to collaborate as a full stack team and provide production-ready software
  - Explore new concepts, libraries, or patterns
  - Practice professional git workflow
  - Build application that executes in development, test, CI, and production enfironments
  
  ```
  
</details>
  
### Wins
  
<details close>
  
  ```
  - CI/CD pipeline implementation
  - Postman mock server used for network requests during development
  - Multiplayer gameplay capability
  
  ```
  
</details>
  
### Challenges
  
<details close>
  
  ```
  - Testing gameplay and different user perspectives(game creator vs joining player) efficiently but thoroughly
  - Developing features for players to join game from a different browing session/window/device - problem approached by using encoded data stored in URL
  - Single-page application routing incompatability with GitHub Pages - problem approached by using a rerouting script in the `index.html` file
  - Having game data update in real time across all participating clients
  
  ```
  
</details>

### Upcoming Features
  
<details close>
  
  ```
  - Light & Dark mode display settings
  - Single-player vs Multi-player modes
  - `Surprise Me` button that will generate a trivia game with a surprise category
  
  ```
